      <p class="description">Humans have used falcons for hunting for thousands of years. Falconry is the art of training and using falcons to hunt small animals and birds. They are believed to hunt several thousand different kinds of species. Their vision is eight times better
        than humans. This allows the birds to spot small prey nearly two miles away. They are also durable and migrate between continents to find food.</p>
